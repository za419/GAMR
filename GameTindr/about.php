		<p class="info">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="gamr">GAMR</span> was written as a team project for the WildHacks 2015 hackathon. It was conceptualized as a way for people who wish to find a party with which to play a multi-player game to find one another and play together. As team member <span class="teammate-name">Murphy Angelo</span> said,
		<p class="info">
			<blockquote>I think that it's disappointing how there are a lot of cool games that people don't really play online, and that you can't really find anyone to play with locally. I wish there was an easier way to find people to play with.</blockquote>
		<p class="info">
			Fellow team members <span class="teammate-name">Elana Stettin</span> and <span class="teammate-name">Ryan Hodin</span> agreed with this sentiment, and thus <span class="gamr">GAMR</span> was born.
